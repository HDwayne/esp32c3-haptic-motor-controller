[![License: CERN-OHL-P-2.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-CERN--OHL--P--2.0-blue)](https://cern-ohl.web.cern.ch/)

The **ESP32-C3 Haptic Motor Controller** is a standalone board designed to drive multiple haptic motors, based on the ESP32-C3-MINI-1U module.  
It features a **DRV2605L** haptic driver for each motor. The board is powered by two parallel LiPo batteries.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: This project has not been tested and will not be tested. It is a concept prototype developed for a student project only. Use it at your own risk.

The PCB is a 4-layer board following the **JLC04161H-3313** stackup:
- **Outer layers**: signals.
- **Inner layers**: ground (GND) and 3.3‚ÄØV power.

üìè Board dimensions: **80 mm x 35 mm**.
